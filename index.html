        This website was created using data from Roza, a microbiologist. Roza's job is to isolate unknown bacteria and classify them. She has a particular interest in bacterial species with the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Roza and her lab have teamed up with Improbable Beef, a company that specializes in creating plant-based beef substitutes. Improbable Beef has used labs across the country, and created great beef tasting products from things like fungi, allege, plants, microorganisms found on plants, etc. but Improbable Beef feels like they could come even closer to the taste of beef. That is where Roza and her research comes in, you see, Roza has a hypothesis on where to get the next best beef like taste. Roza has theorized that since there are thousands upon thousands of different bacteria that grow on humans, one of them must be the one Improbable beef is seeking! Roza has even narrowed her search down to bacteria in the human belly button! Roza has gathered participants from across the nation, to catalog the bacterial species in their belly buttons. That is where this website comes in, Roza wanted a way to share her results with the participants and fellow colleagues and still allow the participants to remain anonymous. Participants have been assigned a number and can select it from the drop down menu to see their results.
